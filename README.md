# Easy_Learn

It is an E - Learning Application.


INTRODUCTION


Suppose a user opens our app so he/she can choose from the various given subjects to study or to revise and after clicking on that subject he or she will be redirected towards that subject database or on a new activity in which there will be name written of the chapters and only 1 chapter is unlocked and all the other are locked and if he/she completes the first chapter then/she will be able to move towards the next chapter. At the ending of every chapter there will be a quiz and a sheet of most important interview questions from the chapter and if the user completes it with a minimum score of 70% then he/she will be able to move forward otherwise he/she will have to repeat the quiz round until he/she get 70% or above in the quiz. 
There will be a timer present in the quiz time which activates only when the quiz is going on and not on the time of the reading or studying for the chapter and if the user completes the quiz on time then he/she will get an option for continue. If user clicks on continue then he/she will be redirected to the next chapter otherwise user can save his/her progress and return after the respective time and can start from where he/she left off.
We will be providing a login activity so that the user can store his/her progress on the database and by this we will ensure that if he/she will uninstall our app and now redownload it so he/she can start from where he/she left. For those who do not signup with us the storing their progress feature will not be available for them they can store their progress till they not clear the storage of app and if they clear there all progress will be lost and they have to start from the beginning.


EXISTING SYSTEM


The Existing System doesn’t fulfill the following :-

•	Lack of theoretical data; i.e., most application does not provide with good quality and quantity of theory that has to be there for better understanding of topics, so they do try to give code examples but not with enough theory to match that.
•	User can only get 1 to 2 code examples for a particular topic which does not make it understandable enough for a beginner.
•	There are no links for websites like GitHub for reference code or for any extension for a particular given code which is avoiding user from an enhanced understanding of code and will never know whether he/she can make that code to be better performing.


USE OF PROJECT


It will be useful for the students who wants to learn programming languages as a beginner. Our app will provide a better interface to the user for learning new languages and revising. User can start the quiz and can also check their knowledge by answering the questions and at last by seeing their progress reports. If he/she passes the quiz above 70% then he/she can proceed further otherwise he/she should have to repeat the process for the betterment of learning.
Our app can be used to learn and implement programming languages as well as get to know your command on that particular language. 
User can give us the doubt through image or text and we will be clearing their doubts and queries through the best way available.


FEASIBILITY OF PROJECT


It will help us and guide in the study for the concepts in an easy way.
We have the technology which is existing and we can implement it to improve the current situations.
It will require the people resources which will let us to improve the task to do better.
It will generate the ROI based on the upcoming factors which are will are beneficial and constrained to the study purposes.
Life Cycle will be acquainted in it because it will lead us to do it in a strategic manner.
Initiation, planning, implementation, and closure 
Well it might turn into a business case study with its applicability .
It will create a business opportunity which with the factors of providing the services such as execution, planning, person to person individual services.
By having a subscription fees we can generate the money which and it might be low in the current but it will be high for sure with the increment of the usage of the application
According to the market survey most of the websites are providing it an uncertain manner but we will provide it in the planned manner such as according to the level of the performance of the candidate we will have task and study plan.

FUTURE SCOPE


•	Earning
We will be adding time wise points allocation for the users which will give them some points to successfully attempting and qualifying the quiz and perform tasks. They will be rewarded with points which can be converted to money by reaching a threshold. They can learn and can make some money at same time. This will motivate the user to give more time studying through our application.
